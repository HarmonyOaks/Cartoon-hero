           <h2>About Penny</h2> 
           <p>Penny is a five year old Golden Retriever. She is a champion Rally dog and is a wonderful companion and therapy dog.  
               She loves to play frisbee and swim in the river.  She greets everyone she sees and gets along easily with other animals.  She grew up on a farm around horses and knows how to behave around large animals. </p>
